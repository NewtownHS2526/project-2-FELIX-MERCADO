      <p>C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains widely used and influential. By design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of the typical CPU architecture, customized for the target instruction set. It has been and continues to be used to implement operating systems (especially kernels[10]), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[11] C is used on computers that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems</p>

        <p>You should learn C because it's a foundational language that provides a deep understanding of how computers work, leading to improved problem-solving skills and better programming in other languages.</p>

          <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[12] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[13][14] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language.[15][1] C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).</p>
