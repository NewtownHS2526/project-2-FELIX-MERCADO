      <p>JavaScript (JS)[a] is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.[6] Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.</p>

        <p>Learning Java is valuable because it is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used in software development. It powers many enterprise applications, Android apps, web servers, and large systems. Java’s “write once, run anywhere” philosophy ensures that code can run on multiple platforms without modification, making it highly portable. Additionally, Java has a large community, extensive libraries, and strong job demand, which makes it a practical language for both beginners and professionals aiming to build scalable, maintainable applications.</p>

          <h1 class="text-2xl bg-green-500 rounded p-4 mb-4">What is the story of the language?</h1>
          <p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13] During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6] The goal was a "language for the masses",[14] "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites".[15] Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][16][17] The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[14] </p>
