      <p>JavaScript (JS)[a] is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.[6] Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.</p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl bg-green-500 rounded p-4 mb-4">Why you should learn javaScript?</h1>
        <p>You should learn JavaScript because it's essential for web development, powering everything from interactive websites to dynamic web applications. It is a versatile language used for front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, with strong career opportunities, a large community, and a wide range of applications beyond the web. Learning it can also open doors to developing mobile apps, games, and server-side programs. </p>

          <h1 class="text-2xl bg-green-500 rounded p-4 mb-4">What is the story of the language?</h1>
          <p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13] During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6] The goal was a "language for the masses",[14] "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites".[15] Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][16][17] The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[14] </p>
