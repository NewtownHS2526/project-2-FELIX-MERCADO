        <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. </p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl bg-green-500 rounded p-4 mb-4">Why you should learn java?</h1>
        <p>You should learn Java because it’s a versatile and powerful programming language used for building everything from mobile apps to large enterprise systems. Its “write once, run anywhere” ability lets your programs work on multiple platforms. Java has a huge community, lots of libraries, and strong job demand, making it a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers.</p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl bg-green-500 rounded p-4 mb-4">What is the story of the language?</h1>
        <p>The programming language Java was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Initially the goal was to build a platform independent language for embedded devices such as set-top boxes and televisions. After exploring C++ (which proved too heavy and too closely tied to platform dependencies), the team embarked on an entirely new project codenamed the “Green Project”. The project first used the name “Green” (internally “Greentalk” with extension .gt), then was renamed “Oak” (inspired by an oak tree outside Gosling’s office). When Sun attempted to trademark “Oak,” they discovered it was already claimed by Oak Technologies, so a further rename was needed. In an interesting session guided by a naming consultant, the team generated dozens of candidate names. The name “Java” (after the Indonesian coffee bean) emerged as the one that cleared legal review. Although Gosling’s preferred name was “Lyric” and the team initially favoured “Silk,” “Java” became the official name.</p>
